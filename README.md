The Health Nutrition & Population Statistics dataset can be utilized to generate a Decision Tree model & Support Vector model to forecast the population growth in each nation based on the birth rate. Using the birth rate as a basis, these two models can produce a precise estimate of any nation's population. This dataset offers important health, nutrition and population statistics that have been compiled from a variety of global and country sources.
